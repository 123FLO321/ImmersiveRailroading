# Immersive Railroading

Immersive Railroading is a Minecraft mod for 1.12.  It adds a new transport system (item and players) to the game.  It is based in real world physics (where possible) and uses life size models to convey the true scale and grandeur of Railroading.

## Alpha:

I will be opening up a public (may become whitelisted) server on Sunday the 10th of September with Immersive Railroading and Immersive Engineering installed.  The default gamemode will be creative as the crafting system is still in the works.

Goals:
* Feedback on implemented features
* Bugtesting
* Multiplayer interaction testing
* Performance testing

## Beta:

Shooting for Saturday the 24th of September
